# Leap Motion Project

## Objective

Controlling a remote device with Leap Motion in a augmented reality setup.

## Approach

Mount a webcam and a Leap controller on a user. The webcam will detect a marker on a cellphone in the videofeed. If the marker is present, the user can "activate" this marker by circling it out with leap motion. An image will pop up on top of this marker. 

## Usage

Runs with cinder 0.8.6 for vc2012 and OpenCV 2.4.10.
OpenCV blocks and sdf file are not included due to file size limitation.
